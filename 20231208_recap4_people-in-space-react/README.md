# People in Space - React Style ðŸš€

## Tasks

### 1

- **Add an element to the html** where we will put the number of people currently in space.

- We probably want to **keep track of the number of people in space via state\*** (try and think of a good react hook for this). We can set the initial value to 0 for now.

### 2

- Now we want to **fetch the data from the api**. There is another hook from React that we want to think about here.
- Fetching data from an external source can be seen as a side effect. Once you have fetched the data don't forget to call **setNumberInSpace**

Congratulations! You have now made a website that shows the current number of people in space using React. Compare this with the people in space project you worked on last week.

### 3

3. As a bonus feature you could **add a ul to the page that gets updated with the names of the people currently in space** (this information is also included in the response from the API). You will probably want to create another state variable. Then we need to remember how to loop over an array in React.

### 4

4. As an extra bonus you could **add 3 buttons** to the page. **All, ISS and Tiangong**. Then when you click on one of the buttons you update the **list of people displayed on the page based on which space craft they are on**. i.e. if you click on the ISS button, your list of people should only include those on the ISS. We learnt about an array method that would be particularly helpful in this scenario.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
